# Introduction
TableToLongForm is an R package that automatically converts
hierarchical Tables intended for a human reader into a LongForm
Dataframe that is machine readable.

This repository is for developers, most users will probably find the
[Home Page for

more informative.

# How to Make
The make process is simple (hopefully). You source in MAKE.R in R and
run the make function. This will take the _base.Rnw file and use it to
create the output .Rnw and _noAppendix.Rnw files. It will also run
tests at this stage, checking that the output Dataframes from the
newly made TableToLongForm matches the output saved previously (stored
in TCconverted.RData).

# Misc
The make process uses
