TableToLongForm automatically converts hierarchical Tables intended
for a human reader into a simple LongForm Dataframe that is machine
readable. It does this by recognising positional queues present in
the hierarchical Table (which would normally be interpreted visually
by the human brain) to decompose, then reconstruct the data into a
LongForm Dataframe. This repository contains the base Literate Program
(Rnw) along with the Literate Documents (pdf).
