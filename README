NOTE: The version on github is not the latest version and is not
currently being updated. The master copy of TableToLongForm resides on
a local University of Auckland subversion repository.  Work is
currently underway to make TableToLongForm more modular and
edit-friendly, after which TableToLongForm will migrate fully to
github. Until then, you can obtain the latest public releases of the
Package and Literate Programs from this page:
https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~joh024/Research/TableToLongForm/

TableToLongForm automatically converts hierarchical Tables intended
for a human reader into a simple LongForm Dataframe that is machine
readable. It does this by recognising positional queues present in the
hierarchical Table (which would normally be interpreted visually by
the human brain) to decompose, then reconstruct the data into a
LongForm Dataframe. This repository contains the base Literate Program
(Rnw) along with the Literate Documents (pdf).
